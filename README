    1.  Description
----------------------------------------

    qCharDev is an application that will, ostensibly, help you develop
    characters for your fiction.  It does this by providing a number of fields
    per character to be filled out, copied from a character development
    worksheet into a template file.  These can then later be exported to PDF,
    assuming you've got the reportlab library installed.

    The default template is located at ./data/template.xml.  You can import
    other custom templates if you want, provided they're formated correctly;
    glance over the default template to see how it's doe if you want to make
    your own.





----------------------------------------
    2.  Requirements

    -   Python 3 (tested:  version 3.6.5)

        - Can be skipped if you don't care about PDF export
